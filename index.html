      <h1> Costa Rica</h1>
      <p>  I was born in Costa Rica and have a big soft spot for the beautiful country. There's so much to do, see, and EAT! I was born in Liberia, Guanacaste, Costa Rica on march 29th, 1999. Both of my parents are also from the same province. </p>

         <h2>Some of the things To Do</h2>
         <p>I last went to Costa Rica in May 2021 and had an amazing time. The time before that I was probably 5 or 6 years old, so I had a lot of catching up to do. One of the first things I did was go see all of my family. As you can assume, they were pretty hysterical seeing me back on my home soil. My mamita Ana (Grandma) made me a delicous meal, pork and gallo pinto. </p>
         <p> One of the things I did while I was in Costa Rica, was ziplining. I was terrified to be honest. I had never gone before and doing it for the first time in the middle of the jungle was definitely one of the coolest things I have ever got to experience. </p>

         <p> Costa Rica is known for being on of the happiest places on Earth. The people there are all very happy and nice people. Everyone will smile and treat you with great hospatality. There's not really any other place quite like it. Pura Vida.</p>
